**Congratulations on completing the Nutanix End User Computing with Citrix lab track!**

.. note::

   Please be respectful and cautious when cleaning up VMs so as not to delete another user's resources.

After you have validated all completed labs with a proctor, please free up memory and IP resources on your cluster by doing the following:

- Do **NOT** delete your *Initials*\ **-WinToolsVM** VM as it can be re-purposed in other labs
- Delete your *Initials*\ **-NPD-##** VMs in **Prism**
- Delete your *Initials*\ **-PD-##** VMs in **Prism**
- Delete your *Initials*\ **-GoldImage** VM in **Prism**
