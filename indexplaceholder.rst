*Welcome! On Wednesday morning, this page will be updated with all available labs and cluster assignment information.*

This year we're celebrating how we power customer use cases by exposing you to multiple new options that will be launched as Bootcamps for you to drive prospect and customer engagement during 2020. During this year's Hands on Learning day, you'll choose and complete **at least** one of four available solution-focused lab tracks.

.. figure:: images/labtracks.png
   :align: center

**Private Cloud Track** - *The Private Cloud labs are highly recommended for all attendees who have been with Nutanix for less than 12 months. This track will dive into common Day 2 administrator and operator workflows, exposing the facets of Nutanix that make it ideal as a Private Cloud foundation for any organization. In these labs you will work with and learn about the core platform, AHV, Prism Pro, Files, Calm, Flow, and more.*

**Databases Track** - *The databases track is ideal for users looking to become more familiar with the benefits the core Nutanix platform, Era, Flow, and Prism Pro can deliver for an organizations most business critical workloads, including Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle.*

**End User Computing (Xi Frame)** - *The EUX Xi Frame track walks you through an end to end deployment of Xi Frame on AHV, including gold image creation, desktop management, Files integration,  securing desktops with Flow, and more.*

**End User Computing (Citrix)** - *The EUC Citrix track provides a pre-deployed Citrix Delivery Controller, and walks you through integration with AHV, golden image creation, desktop management, Files integration with user profiles, securing desktops with Flow, and more.*

**Bonus Labs** - *There are a number of standalone labs that can be completed independent of your chosen lab track. These labs can be completed at any time. There are periods of time during the solution lab tracks where you may be provisioning an application, database, etc. where you will have 15 minutes or more that can be spent working on Bonus labs, or labs from an alternate solution track.*

Labs are designed to be completed by each individual, not in groups.

For each lab you complete & validate, you'll be entered into a raffle to win your choice of several prizes, including: `Apple AirPods <https://www.apple.com/airpods-2nd-generation/>`_, `Samsung Galaxy Buds <https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-buds/>`_, `DJI Tello EDU Drone <https://store.dji.com/product/tello-edu?vid=47091>`_, `Logitech Spotlight Presentation Remote <https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/spotlight-presentation-remote>`_, `Sega Genesis Mini <https://genesismini.sega.com/>`_, and `CanaKit Raspberry Pi 4 Kit <https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-4GB-Starter-Kit/dp/B07V5JTMV9/>`_!

..   **Proctors will be regularly checking in with each table to validate completed labs. You do NOT need to wait for lab validation before proceeding to your next lab, but please take the time to clean up unneeded VMs after each lab validation.**
