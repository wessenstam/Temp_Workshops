The Private Cloud track is highly suggested for SEs who have been with Nutanix less than 6 months. Once you begin a track, make sure to complete the labs within the track IN ORDER, as some exercises may be dependent on work completed in the previous exercise. Bonus labs may be completed at any time.</font></strong>
