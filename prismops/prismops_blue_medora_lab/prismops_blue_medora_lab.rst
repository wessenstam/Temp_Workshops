Monitoring MSSQL with Prism Pro
-------------------------------

.. figure:: images/operationstriangle.png

Prism Pro brings smart automation to our customerâ€™s daily IT operations. The typical operations workflow is a continuous cycle of monitoring, analyzing and taking action where necessary. Prism Pro mirrors traditional IT Admin's workflows to improve operations efficiency. With Prism Pro, IT Admins are able to connect insights from machine data to automate this typical flow using the power of the machine learning engine X-FIT and the X-Play automation engine.

In this lab you will learn how Prism Pro can help IT Admins monitor, analyze and automatically act on data from our partner Blue Medora.

Lab Setup
+++++++++

Please be sure to complete the `Deploying MS SQL` lab as you will need to use the MSSQL server to complete this lab.

#. Open your Prism Central and navigate to the VMs page. Note down the IP Address of the `GTSPrismOpsLabUtilityServer`.

   .. figure:: images/init1.png

#. Open a new tab in the browser, and navigate to http://`<GTSPrismOpsLabUtilityServer_IP_ADDRESS>`/databases [example http://10.42.113.52/databases]. It is possible you may need to log into the VM if you are the first one to use it. Just fill out the **Prism Central IP**, **Username** and **Password** and click **Login**.

   .. figure:: images/init2.png

#. Now fill in the details, including your initials, email and select the VM you created in the `Deploying MS SQL` and click begin to begin the Blue Medora lab.

#. Now navigate to `http://<GTSPrismOpsLabUtilityServer_IP_ADDRESS>/` to complete the lab from. Use the UI at this URL to complete the lab.

Monitoring MSSQL with Blue Medora
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Prism Pro has partnered with Blue Medora to collect metrics and data that Blue Medora monitors and expose them in the Prism Central console. This feature will be having an Early Access phase in 5.17 and is planned to go GA in 5.18. Using these additional metrics, Prism Pro can give more insights into Database workloads such as MSSQL. Let's take a look.

#. Navigate to the **Alerts** page by clicking the bell icon in the top of the navigation bar. Notice you have an alert claiming **SQL server query average latency high**. Click on the alert that has your MSSQL VM listed in the **Source Entity** column to take a closer look.

   .. figure:: images/bm1.png

#. From the alert details we can see that the query latency shot up recently and is now much higher than it had been previously. Click on the **View Details** link so we can investigate a bit further.

   .. figure:: images/bm2.png

#. In this view you can see the metrics that we are collecting from Blue Medora. Using this machine learning engine X-FIT, Prism Pro is also able to generate baselines, or expected ranges, for these synced metrics. The X-FIT alogrithms learn the normal behavior of these entities and represent that as a baseline range on the different charts. Whenever a metric value deviates from this expected range, Prism Pro will raise an anomaly. From this view we can see that while number of queries and connections have remained constant, the CPU usage and query latency have shot up and anomalous data points have been identified. To investigate further click the **Queries** menu item in the left side of the view.

   .. figure:: images/bm3.png

#. From this view, we can see that a new query type has been flagged and it appears that this query is taking much longer to execute (208 seconds). Now that we have identified the cause of the issue, lets use X-Play to remediate the situation. The MSSQL server needs it's memory increased to handle the memory consumption of the new query. We will run a Manual playbook to increase the MSSQL instance memory.

   .. figure:: images/bm4.png

#. From the **More** menu at the top of the screen, open the dropdown and select the **Run Playbook** option.

   .. figure:: images/bm5.png

#. Select the Playbook with your initials in it and click **Run**. This will execute a powershell script to increase the MSSQL instance memory, and it will also send you an email notifying you of the update.

   .. figure:: images/bm6.png

#. Navigate to the **Playbooks** view using the search bar.

   .. figure:: images/bm7.png

#. Open the playbook with your initials in it.

   .. figure:: images/bm9.png

#. From this popup, click the **Plays** tab. You can see that the playbook did run successfully. If you want, you can click on the Play to take a deeper look into the details. Now lets see how we can automate this workflow. In the upper right corner of the popup, click the Update button.

   .. figure:: images/bm10.png

#. Click the **Change Trigger** link, so we can go ahead and swap out the Manual trigger with an alert trigger.

   .. figure:: images/bm11.png

#. Select the **Alert** trigger tile.

   .. figure:: images/bm12.png

#. Search for the **SQL Server Avg Query Latency high** alert policy. We will use this alert policy as the triggering criteria for the alert trigger.

   .. figure:: images/bm13.png

#. Go ahead and save the update. Now if an alert is ever generated for **SQL Server Avg Query Latency high**, this playbook will automatically execute.

Takeaways
.........

- IT operations are complex, error-prone, and siloed. With Prism Pro, IT admins can get visibility into and automate the entire stack, end-to-end.

- The Blue Medora integration extends Prism Pro's capabilities into the application layer. By bringing application performance data into Prism, all of Prism Pro's values like X-FIT based anomaly-detection and X-Play (IFTTT-like) automation naturally extend into the application layer. IT admins can now automate their workflows for not just VMs, but for their applications too!

- The feature is currently avaiable for a limited early access, and will be released later this year (as part of the 5.18 release). The first release will support database applications like MS SQL server and Oracle DB.
